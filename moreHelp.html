	<h1>How exactly does this work?</h1>
	<img src = "howDrag.png">
	<p>By dragging blocks to the gray box, you are telling Kristie what to do. She will read through your instructions and do them in order.</p>
	<p>Blocks like "attack" tell Kristie exactly what to do once.</p>
	<img src = "attackBlock.png">
	<p>Blocks with a little tail are special. The "repeat" block will cause everything inside it to happen again and again. </p>
